In recent years, the proliferation of IoT devices has transformed the urban landscape, leading to the emergence of so-called smart cities.
 These cities integrate various technologies such as sensors, IoT devices, and big data analytics to improve the efficiency of services including transportation, energy management, and public safety.
 For instance, sensors embedded in the road infrastructure can help in optimizing traffic flow and reducing congestion. Similarly, smart energy meters in homes and businesses enable more efficient energy use by providing real-time data to both users and energy providers.
 Furthermore, IoT devices play a crucial role in enhancing public safety by enabling the rapid deployment of emergency services in response to real-time data on accidents or other incidents.
 However, the integration of these technologies also raises significant challenges, particularly concerning data security and privacy, requiring robust solutions to shield sensitive information from potential cyber threats.
